# Important!
Sadly, this project is on hold as it's impossible to find an SSOP-to-DIP adapter for this screen (soldering is not an option). Sparkfun used to provide this, but that product is no longer available. I've done everything I can, but since it's impossible to test it, this project will remain paused.
